add saving

add UI:
        on top left show 2d map
        on bottom left put a slider for the timespeed,
    menu for saving, loading, creating new, exiting
        separate UI layer that gets enabled or disabled that's on top of everything else 

figure out lighting system

add graphical indicator of the rain state of each biome

add rivers and other bodies of water
    these will affect humidity
    rivers from high points to low points
        also involves the amount of snow/ice buildup
    lakes/oceans at low points
        make this the default so that anythying that isn't touched by a mountain is underwater
            then make the largest continuous body of water ocean, and the rest randomly decided based off of distance to the ocean
                I.E. 50/50 on the coast, lower and lower until asymptote if further inland/higher
        also involves biome split between above and below water with beach as a 1-2 chunk buffer
        this will be when i flush out wetlands more


add more complexity to soil system
    involves layers of strata based on the biome
    soil depth

add more complexity to weather system
    create a weather class that includes 
        precipitation amount
        sun amount
        temperature change
        a Vector3 wind direction
    create circulation patterns based off of elevation, biomes, and humidity
        this will be done via a linkedlist of vector3 points
            these will affect the wind direction of the weather
        each circulation pattern will be associated with a season and would have a corresponding weather object for every chunk
            weather objects would then be combined via vector addition to determine the weather of all the chunks
    more types of weather than just snow/rain
        fog
        dew
        distinction between snow/ice
        NATURAL DISASTERS

add PLANTS:
    organism class
        growth means how big the thing currently is from 0-100
            will have a polynomial equation associated with it to determine nutrient requirements/usage at different ages
                I.E. while growing fast, the nutrients stored in it will grow a lot 
        nutrients encapsulates how many nutrients the thing has right now in it
            goes up with growth
            has a static usage rate based on the nutrient level
                I.E. .2 * x
                    don't know if this is accurate, more research needed
        split into asexual and sexual child classes based on reproduction
            asexual:
                if growth > reproduction threshhold and food source > damage threshhold
                    clone self with noise mapped on self's traits
    food source class
        current and max food levels
        threshhold for taking damage/nutrients from self
        photosynthesis:
            does the plant have sun
                if yes, then take water and nutrients from the soil to generate food
    genetic trait class
        TODO

add erosion from wind/water on larger timescales
