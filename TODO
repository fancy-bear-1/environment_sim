add seed and saving

add UI:
    year, day
        text on top center of screen
    selected biome data
        draw pie chart for CSS
        show temperature and humidity as text
        on top right of screen
        on top left show 2d map
            very baby easy, just have static top-down camera
    menu for saving, loading, creating new, exiting
        separate UI layer that gets enabled or disabled that's on top of everything else 

figure out lighting system

add rivers and other bodies of water
    rivers from high points to low points
        also involves the amount of snow/ice buildup
    lakes/oceans at low points
        make this the default so that anythying that isn't touched by a mountain is underwater
            then make the largest continuous body of water ocean, and the rest randomly decided based off of distance to the ocean
                I.E. 50/50 on the coast, lower and lower until asymptote if further inland/higher
        also involves biome split between above and below water with beach as a 1-2 chunk buffer
        

add more complexity to soil system
    involves layers of strata based on the biome
    soil depth

add more complexity to weather system
    create circulation patterns based off of elevation and bodies of water
    more types of weather than just snow/rain
        fog
        dew
        distinction between snow/ice
        NATURAL DISASTERS

add PLANTS:
    organism abstract class
        growth means how big the thing currently is from 0-100
            will have a polynomial equation associated with it to determine nutrient requirements/usage at different ages
                I.E. while growing fast, the nutrients stored in it will grow a lot 
        nutrients encapsulates how many nutrients the thing has right now in it
            goes up with growth
            has a static usage rate based on the nutrient level
                I.E. .2 * x
                    don't know if this is accurate, more research needed
        split into asexual and sexual child classes based on reproduction
            asexual:
                if growth > reproduction threshhold and food source > damage threshhold
                    clone self with noise mapped on self's traits
    food source class
        current and max food levels
        threshhold for taking damage/nutrients from self
        photosynthesis:
            does the plant have sun
                if yes, then take water and nutrients from the soil to generate food
    genetic trait class
        TODO

add erosion from wind/water on larger timescales
